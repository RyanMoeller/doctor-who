      <h1>Richard E. Grant</h1>
      <p><img src="../../images/villains/actors/richard-e-grant.jpg" width="250" height="250" class="image-rap"><strong>Richard E. Grant</strong> (born <strong>Richard Grant Esterhuysen;</strong> 5 May 1957) is a British actor, screenwriter, and director.He came to public attention in 1987 for playing Withnail in the film <em>Withnail and I</em>, and achieved international recognition as John Seward in the 1992 blockbuster <em>Bram Stoker's Dracula</em>. Grant was a member of the Space Theatre Company in Cape Town before moving to London in 1982. He later stated, &quot;I grew up in Swaziland when it was mired in a 1960s sensibility. The kind of English spoken where I grew up was a period English sound and when I came to England people said, 'how strange'. Charles Sturridge, who directed <em>Brideshead Revisited</em> for TV, said, 'you speak English like someone from the 1950s'.&quot;</p>
      <p><br>
        Grant's first film role was the perpetually inebriated title character in <em>Withnail and I</em>, which has established a large cult following. Following his film <em>Withnail and I</em>, Grant began appearing in Hollywood films, and quickly established himself as a powerful character actor in a wide array of films, from blockbuster studio movies to small independent projects. Over the past twenty years, Grant has had strong supporting roles in the films <em>Henry &amp; June</em>, <em>L.A. Story</em>, <em>The Player</em>, <em>The Age of Innocence</em>, <em>The Portrait of a Lady</em>, <em>Spice World</em>, <em>Gosford Park</em>, <em>Bright Young Things</em>, and <em>Penelope</em>.</p>
      <p><br>
        Grant has twice portrayed the Doctor from <em>Doctor Who</em>, both outside the main continuity. In the comedy sketch <em>Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death</em>, he portrayed a version of the Tenth Doctor, referred to as the Quite Handsome Doctor. He also voiced a version of the Ninth Doctor for the BBC original animated webcast <em>Scream of the Shalka</em>. The latter had intended to be the official Ninth Doctor prior the revival of the TV series. In August, 2012, the BBC announced that Grant would join the cast of <em>Doctor Who</em> for &quot;The Snowmen&quot;, in which he plays a villain, Dr. Walter Simeon. He appeared again in the following episode, &quot;The Bells of Saint John&quot; as the Great Intelligence, one of the Second Doctor's most infamous villains and, prior to &quot;The Snowmen&quot; (played by Ian McKellen), was last seen in <em>The Abominable Snowmen</em> and <em>The Web of Fear</em>. Grant reprises the role in the series 7 finale, &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot;.</p>
