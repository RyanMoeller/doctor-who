      <h1>Peter Capaldi</h1>
      <p>Peter Capaldi was born in&nbsp;Glasgow. His mother's family was from&nbsp;Killeshandra,&nbsp;County Cavan, Ireland, and his father's family was from&nbsp;Picinisco, Italy.&nbsp;He was educated at St Teresa's Primary School in&nbsp;Possilpark,&nbsp;St Matthew's Primary School in&nbsp;Bishopbriggs, and&nbsp;St Ninian's High School, Kirkintilloch,&nbsp;before attending the&nbsp;Glasgow School of Art.</p>
      <p><br>
      Capaldi displayed an early talent for performance by putting on a&nbsp;puppet&nbsp;show in primary school. While at high school, he was a member of the Antonine Players, who performed at the Fort Theatre in Bishopbriggs. As an art student, he was the lead singer in a&nbsp;punk rock&nbsp;band called Dreamboys, whose drummer was future comedian Craig Ferguson. </p>
      <p><br>
        Capaldi has appeared in over 40 films and television shows since his appearance as Danny Oldsen in&nbsp;<em>Local Hero</em>&nbsp;(1983). He had a role in&nbsp;<em>The Lair of the White Worm</em>(1988) and&nbsp;<em>Dangerous Liaisons</em>&nbsp;(1988), and was featured as Ozzy in a 1985 episode of&nbsp;<em>Minder</em>. He voiced Chief Petty Officer Grieves in the&nbsp;BBC Radio&nbsp;Ministry of Defence&nbsp;comedy&nbsp;<em>Our Brave Boys</em>. Capaldi's first starring role on television was as Luke Wakefield, a&nbsp;closeted&nbsp;gay&nbsp;man who imagines he has witnessed a crime, in the BBC&nbsp;drama series&nbsp;<em>Mr Wakefield's Crusade</em>. He played fictional&nbsp;<em>Songs of Praise</em>&nbsp;producer Tristan Campbell in two episodes of the sitcom&nbsp;<em>Vicar of Dibley</em>, and a transvestite&nbsp;in&nbsp;ITV's&nbsp;<em>Prime Suspect 3</em>. In&nbsp;Neil Gaiman's gothic fantasy&nbsp;<em>Neverwhere</em>, he portrayed the&nbsp;angel&nbsp;Islington.<br>
      Capaldi is also an&nbsp;audio book&nbsp;narrator, and his many titles include several of the works of&nbsp;Iain Banks. He starred as Rory in the 1996 television version of Banks's&nbsp;<em>The Crow Road</em>.</p>
      <p><br>
      In the 1999&nbsp;Channel 4&nbsp;series&nbsp;<em>Psychos</em>, he played a mathematician with&nbsp;bipolar disorder. Capaldi made an appearance as a&nbsp;university professor&nbsp;in the sitcom&nbsp;<em>Peep Show</em>, and played a&nbsp;prime suspect&nbsp;in the 2007 series of&nbsp;<em>Waking the Dead</em>. In 2007, Capaldi appeared as Mark Jenkins (Sid's dad) in the&nbsp;E4&nbsp;teen comedy drama series <em>Skins</em>. He returned for a second series in 2008, only to be killed off in the third episode. He appeared in the&nbsp;<em>Midsomer Murders</em>&nbsp;episode &quot;Death in Chorus&quot; and ITV1's <em>Fallen Angel</em>. He also appeared in the 2007 British comedy film&nbsp;<em>Magicians</em>.</p>
      <p><br>
      He appeared as&nbsp;King Charles I&nbsp;in the Channel 4 series&nbsp;<em>The Devil's Whore</em>, aired in 2008. Capaldi provided his voice for the&nbsp;animated film&nbsp;<em>Haunted Hogmanay</em>&nbsp;in 2006. He played Balthazar, one of the&nbsp;Biblical Magi, in the 2010 BBC adaptation of&nbsp;<em>The Nativity</em>. </p>
      <p><br>
      In November 2011, he began playing Professor Marcus in&nbsp;<em>The Ladykillers</em>&nbsp;at the&nbsp;Liverpool Playhouse, then transferred to the Gielgud Theatre in London. The original run closed at the Gielgud on 14 April 2012. He appeared in&nbsp;<em>The Field of Blood</em>&nbsp;as Dr. Pete, for which he received a BAFTA Scotland nomination in the TV actor/actress category; he was beaten by his co-star&nbsp;Jayd Johnson. He had a small role as a&nbsp;therapist&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>Big Fat Gypsy Gangster</em>, written by and starring his&nbsp;<em>Getting On</em>&nbsp;co-star&nbsp;Ricky Grover. In 2012, Capaldi played Randall Brown, the new Head of News, on the&nbsp;BBC2&nbsp;drama&nbsp;<em>The Hour</em>. He appeared as a&nbsp;WHO&nbsp;doctor in&nbsp;<em>World War Z</em>&nbsp;(2013), and had a role in&nbsp;<em>Maleficent</em>&nbsp;(2014), but his part in the latter movie was cut during post-production. </p>
      <p><br>
      He starred in&nbsp;<em>Inside the Mind of Leonardo</em>, a documentary about&nbsp;Leonardo da Vinci. In 2013 he portrayed&nbsp;Alan Rusbridger, the editor of&nbsp;The Guardian&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>The Fifth Estate</em>. In 2014 he starred in a new adaptation of&nbsp;<em>The Three Musketeers</em>&nbsp;as&nbsp;Cardinal Richelieu&nbsp;on&nbsp;BBC One. </p>
      <p><br>
      Capaldi is best known for his role as&nbsp;spin doctor&nbsp;Malcolm Tucker&nbsp;in the BBC sitcom&nbsp;<em>The Thick of It</em>, which he played from 2005 to 2012. Tucker is said to be largely, if loosely, based upon&nbsp;Tony Blair's right-hand man&nbsp;Alastair Campbell, although Capaldi has said that he based his performance more on Hollywood power players, such as the often abrasive&nbsp;Harvey Weinstein.&nbsp;A film spin-off from&nbsp;<em>The Thick of It</em>&nbsp;called&nbsp;<em>In the Loop</em>&nbsp;(in which Capaldi returned to the role of Tucker), was released in 2009.</p>
      <p><br>
      The role of Tucker won Capaldi several awards. In 2006, he was nominated for the&nbsp;BAFTA&nbsp;and RTS Best Comedy Actor Awards. He won the&nbsp;2010 BAFTA Television Award&nbsp;for Male&nbsp;Performance in a Comedy Role. He also won the 2010 British Comedy Award for Best TV Comedy Actor. </p>
      <p><br>
      Capaldi plays the&nbsp;twelfth incarnation&nbsp;of&nbsp;the Doctor&nbsp;in the BBC science-fiction series&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>. His casting was announced on 4 August 2013 in a special BBC programme hosted by&nbsp;ZoÃ« Ball.&nbsp;Capaldi first appeared as the Doctor in a cameo in the 50th anniversary special, &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, before appearing in the 2013 Christmas special, &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;. A lifelong fan of the series, Capaldi had previously played Lobus Caecilius in the 2008 episode &quot;The Fires of Pompeii&quot; as well as playing civil servant&nbsp;John Frobisher&nbsp;in the 2009 spin-off&nbsp;<em>Torchwood: Children of Earth</em>. </p>
      <p><br>
        Before taking the role, Capaldi stated that he had to seriously consider the increased level of visibility that would come with the part.&nbsp;He revealed in an interview that he had been invited to audition for the role of the&nbsp;Eighth Doctor&nbsp;in 1995 prior to the production of&nbsp;the 1996 TV film&nbsp;but didn't go, as he &quot;didn't think [he] would get it, and...didn't want to just be part of a big cull of actors&quot;.<br>
      In 1995, Capaldi won an&nbsp;Oscar&nbsp;for&nbsp;Best Live Action Short Film&nbsp;for his film&nbsp;<em>Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life</em>, which was tied with fellow nominee&nbsp;<em>Trevor</em>, leading to both films being announced as joint winners. He also wrote&nbsp;<em>Soft Top, Hard Shoulder</em>, which won the audience award at the&nbsp;London Film Festival, and wrote and directed <em>Strictly Sinatra</em>&nbsp;and directed the&nbsp;BBC Four&nbsp;sitcom&nbsp;<em>Getting On</em>&nbsp;(one episode of which he appeared in as a doctor). In 2006, Capaldi wrote and presented&nbsp;<em>A Portrait of Scotland</em>, a documentary detailing 500 years' history of Scottish portrait painting. </p>
      <p><br>
      In 2012, Capaldi wrote (with&nbsp;Tony Roche), directed and performed in&nbsp;<em>The Cricklewood Greats</em>, an affectionate spoof documentary about a fictitious film studio, which tracks real developments and trends throughout the history of British cinema, including silent movies,&nbsp;horror&nbsp;and&nbsp;bawdy comedy, and a disastrous&nbsp;Terry Gilliam&nbsp;epic (Gilliam appears as himself).</p>
      <p><br>
        In 2013, Capaldi wrote and directed&nbsp;<em>Born to be King</em>. <br>
      Capaldi is a patron of the&nbsp;Association for International Cancer Research, and the Scottish children's charity, the&nbsp;Aberlour Child Care Trust. He lives in&nbsp;Crouch Endwith his wife, Elaine Collins, and their daughter, Cecily. </p>
