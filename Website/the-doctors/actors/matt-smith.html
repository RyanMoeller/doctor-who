      <h1>Matt Smith</h1>
      <p>Matt Smith was born and raised in&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northampton" title="Northampton">Northampton</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northamptonshire" title="Northamptonshire">Northamptonshire</a>. He attended&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northampton_School_for_Boys" title="Northampton School for Boys">Northampton School for Boys</a>. He had planned to be a professional&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_(soccer)" title="Football (soccer)">football</a>&nbsp;player, having played for the youth teams of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northampton_Town_F.C." title="Northampton Town F.C.">Northampton Town</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C." title="Nottingham Forest F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C." title="Leicester City F.C.">Leicester City</a>.&nbsp;After a serious back injury ruined this career, his drama teacher introduced him to acting by signing him up as the tenth juror in an adaptation of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Angry_Men_(play)" title="Twelve Angry Men (play)"><em>Twelve Angry Men</em></a>&nbsp;without his consent. Although he took part in the play, he refused to attend a drama festival for which his teacher had also signed him up, as he saw himself as a football player and did not view acting as socially acceptable. His drama teacher persisted, and eventually persuaded him to join the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Youth_Theatre" title="National Youth Theatre">National Youth Theatre</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>.</p>
      <p><br>
      After leaving school, Smith studied drama and creative writing at the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_East_Anglia" title="University of East Anglia">University of East Anglia</a>, graduating in 2005. His first theatre roles as part of the National Youth Theatre were&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Becket" title="Thomas Becket">Thomas Becket</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_the_Cathedral" title="Murder in the Cathedral"><em>Murder in the Cathedral</em></a>&nbsp;and Basoon in&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_and_Margarita#Adaptations" title="The Master and Margarita"><em>The Master and Margarita</em></a>. His role in the latter earned him an agent and his first professional jobs,&nbsp;<em>Fresh Kills</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Shore_of_the_Wide_World" title="On the Shore of the Wide World"><em>On the Shore of the Wide World</em></a>. His new professional roles led him to seek an agreement with his university so that he could graduate without attending lectures in his final year. </p>
      <p><br>
        Smith's first television role was as&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Lockhart" title="Sally Lockhart">Jim Taylor</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a>&nbsp;adaptations of the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Lockhart" title="Sally Lockhart"><em>Sally Lockhart</em></a>&nbsp;quartet books&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ruby_in_the_Smoke" title="The Ruby in the Smoke"><em>The Ruby in the Smoke</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_in_the_North" title="The Shadow in the North"><em>The Shadow in the North</em></a>. His first major television role came in the television series&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_Animals_(TV_series)" title="Party Animals (TV series)"><em>Party Animals</em></a>, a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_television_drama" title="BBC television drama">BBC television drama</a>&nbsp;series about fictional&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Government" title="Her Majesty's Government">parliamentary</a>&nbsp;advisors and researchers in&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster" title="Westminster">Westminster</a>. In&nbsp;<em>Party Animals</em>, Smith portrays Danny Foster, a parliamentary researcher to Jo Porter (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raquel_Cassidy" title="Raquel Cassidy">Raquel Cassidy</a>), a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour</a>&nbsp;politician and junior&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office" title="Home Office">Home Office</a>&nbsp;minister. At 26 years old, Danny is described as an intelligent but timid &quot;politics geek&quot; who should have moved on from researching at his age. Within the series' narrative, he attempts to balance his affections for Kirsty MacKenzie (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Riseborough" title="Andrea Riseborough">Andrea Riseborough</a>), his intern, while trying to prevent Porter's imminent decline. <br>
      In an interview in 2007, Smith discussed his character's motivations. He summarised Danny as having a romantic outlook of the political world while being cynical elsewhere. The character was drawn into politics by his father and his own political drive. He defended his character's age by characterising him as being loyal to Porter, instead of being incompetent. He talked about his character's emotional and intellectual maturity: emotionally, he lacks confidence around women—most notably seen with his unrequited love towards Kirsty—but Smith portrays Danny as a caring and sensitive but &quot;wry, sarcastic, [and] witty&quot; romantic; and intellectually, Danny is portrayed as attentive and possessing a strong work ethic. </p>
      <p><br>
      Smith was revealed as the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventh_Doctor" title="Eleventh Doctor">Eleventh Doctor</a>&nbsp;in the British science-fiction television series&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who" title="Doctor Who"><em>Doctor Who</em></a>&nbsp;in January 2009 to replace&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tennant" title="David Tennant">David Tennant</a>, who announced his departure in October 2008. Smith was a relatively unknown actor compared to the actors then speculated about possibly taking on the role, who included&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paterson_Joseph" title="Paterson Joseph">Paterson Joseph</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Morrissey" title="David Morrissey">David Morrissey</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Pertwee" title="Sean Pertwee">Sean Pertwee</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Nesbitt" title="James Nesbitt">James Nesbitt</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Tovey" title="Russell Tovey">Russell Tovey</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Zeta-Jones" title="Catherine Zeta-Jones">Catherine Zeta-Jones</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiwetel_Ejiofor" title="Chiwetel Ejiofor">Chiwetel Ejiofor</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Carlyle" title="Robert Carlyle">Robert Carlyle</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Piper" title="Billie Piper">Billie Piper</a>. Smith was first named as a possible successor less than a day before he was announced as the Eleventh Doctor, on 3 January 2009 edition of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Breakfast" title="BBC Breakfast"><em>BBC Breakfast</em></a>&nbsp;among the names speculated about.&nbsp;His obscurity prompted the news headline &quot;Doctor Who?&quot;, a riff on the show's title. </p>
      <p><br>
      Smith was one of the earliest actors to audition for the role, performing on the first day. The production team, consisting of the incoming producer,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Moffat" title="Steven Moffat">Steven Moffat</a>, and BBC Wales Head of Drama and executive producer,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Wenger" title="Piers Wenger">Piers Wenger</a>, immediately singled him out based on his performance.&nbsp;Smith additionally auditioned for the role of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Watson" title="Dr. Watson">John Watson</a>&nbsp;in the Moffat-created&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(TV_series)" title="Sherlock (TV series)"><em>Sherlock</em></a>, undergoing auditions at the same time; he was unsuccessful, as Moffat believed his eccentric acting style was closer to&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes" title="Sherlock Holmes">Holmes</a>, whose role had already been given to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_Cumberbatch" title="Benedict Cumberbatch">Benedict Cumberbatch</a>. At 26 years old, Smith was three years younger than&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Davison" title="Peter Davison">Peter Davison</a>&nbsp;was at the time of his casting as the Doctor in 1981, and younger than any other actor suggested for the role. After three weeks of auditions, Moffat and Wenger agreed that it had &quot;always been Matt&quot; and approached him to accept the role. The BBC were cautious about casting him because they felt that a 26-year-old could not play the Doctor adequately; Wenger shared the same sentiment but thought Smith had proven his acting quality in&nbsp;<em>Party Animals</em>, which Wenger thought highlighted Smith's &quot;<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mercurial" title="wikt:mercurial">mercurial</a>&nbsp;qualities&quot;. Some fans of the show believed that Smith was inexperienced and too young for the role, while others supported him by citing his demonstrated acting ability.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Smith_(actor)#cite_note-23">[23]</a>&nbsp;For his performance in his first series he was nominated in the Outstanding Drama Performance Category of the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Television_Awards" title="National Television Awards">National Television Awards</a>. Smith is the first Doctor to be nominated for a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_Television_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="British Academy Television Award for Best Actor">BAFTA for Best Actor</a>.</p>
      <p><br>
      Smith has said of his character: &quot;The Doctor is excited and fascinated by the tiniest of things. By everything. By every single thing. That's what's wonderful about him as a character. It's why children like him, I think. Because he doesn't dismiss anything. He's not cynical. He's open to every single facet of the universe.&quot; In June 2010, Smith appeared on stage with&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_(band)" title="Orbital (band)">Orbital</a>, and performed with them a version of the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_theme_music" title="Doctor Who theme music"><em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;theme</a>, at the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury_Festival_2010" title="Glastonbury Festival 2010">Glastonbury Festival</a>.&nbsp;Smith hosted the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_Prom_(2010)" title="Doctor Who Prom (2010)"><em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;Prom</a>at the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Albert_Hall" title="Royal Albert Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>&nbsp;on 24–25 July 2010.

On 1 June 2013, the BBC announced that Smith would be leaving <em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;at the end of the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Christmas_special_(Doctor_Who)" title="2013 Christmas special (Doctor Who)">2013 Christmas special</a>. </p>
