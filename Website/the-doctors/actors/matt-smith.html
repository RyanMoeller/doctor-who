      <h1>Matt Smith</h1>
      <p>Matt Smith was born and raised in&nbsp;Northampton,&nbsp;Northamptonshire. He attended&nbsp;Northampton School for Boys. He had planned to be a professional&nbsp;football&nbsp;player, having played for the youth teams of&nbsp;Northampton Town,&nbsp;Nottingham Forest, and&nbsp;Leicester City.&nbsp;After a serious back injury ruined this career, his drama teacher introduced him to acting by signing him up as the tenth juror in an adaptation of&nbsp;<em>Twelve Angry Men</em>&nbsp;without his consent. Although he took part in the play, he refused to attend a drama festival for which his teacher had also signed him up, as he saw himself as a football player and did not view acting as socially acceptable. His drama teacher persisted, and eventually persuaded him to join the&nbsp;National Youth Theatre&nbsp;in&nbsp;London.</p>
      <p><br>
      After leaving school, Smith studied drama and creative writing at the&nbsp;University of East Anglia, graduating in 2005. His first theatre roles as part of the National Youth Theatre were&nbsp;Thomas Becket&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>Murder in the Cathedral</em>&nbsp;and Basoon in&nbsp;<em>The Master and Margarita</em>. His role in the latter earned him an agent and his first professional jobs,&nbsp;<em>Fresh Kills</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>On the Shore of the Wide World</em>. His new professional roles led him to seek an agreement with his university so that he could graduate without attending lectures in his final year. </p>
      <p><br>
        Smith's first television role was as&nbsp;Jim Taylor&nbsp;in the&nbsp;BBC&nbsp;adaptations of the&nbsp;<em>Sally Lockhart</em>&nbsp;quartet books&nbsp;<em>The Ruby in the Smoke</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Shadow in the North</em>. His first major television role came in the television series&nbsp;<em>Party Animals</em>, a&nbsp;BBC television drama&nbsp;series about fictional&nbsp;parliamentary&nbsp;advisors and researchers in&nbsp;Westminster. In&nbsp;<em>Party Animals</em>, Smith portrays Danny Foster, a parliamentary researcher to Jo Porter (Raquel Cassidy), a&nbsp;Labour&nbsp;politician and junior&nbsp;Home Office&nbsp;minister. At 26 years old, Danny is described as an intelligent but timid &quot;politics geek&quot; who should have moved on from researching at his age. Within the series' narrative, he attempts to balance his affections for Kirsty MacKenzie (Andrea Riseborough), his intern, while trying to prevent Porter's imminent decline. <br>
      In an interview in 2007, Smith discussed his character's motivations. He summarised Danny as having a romantic outlook of the political world while being cynical elsewhere. The character was drawn into politics by his father and his own political drive. He defended his character's age by characterising him as being loyal to Porter, instead of being incompetent. He talked about his character's emotional and intellectual maturity: emotionally, he lacks confidence around women—most notably seen with his unrequited love towards Kirsty—but Smith portrays Danny as a caring and sensitive but &quot;wry, sarcastic, [and] witty&quot; romantic; and intellectually, Danny is portrayed as attentive and possessing a strong work ethic. </p>
      <p><br>
      Smith was revealed as the&nbsp;Eleventh Doctor&nbsp;in the British science-fiction television series&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;in January 2009 to replace&nbsp;David Tennant, who announced his departure in October 2008. Smith was a relatively unknown actor compared to the actors then speculated about possibly taking on the role, who included&nbsp;Paterson Joseph,&nbsp;David Morrissey,&nbsp;Sean Pertwee,&nbsp;James Nesbitt,&nbsp;Russell Tovey,&nbsp;Catherine Zeta-Jones,&nbsp;Chiwetel Ejiofor,&nbsp;Robert Carlyle&nbsp;and&nbsp;Billie Piper. Smith was first named as a possible successor less than a day before he was announced as the Eleventh Doctor, on 3 January 2009 edition of&nbsp;<em>BBC Breakfast</em>&nbsp;among the names speculated about.&nbsp;His obscurity prompted the news headline &quot;Doctor Who?&quot;, a riff on the show's title. </p>
      <p><br>
      Smith was one of the earliest actors to audition for the role, performing on the first day. The production team, consisting of the incoming producer,&nbsp;Steven Moffat, and BBC Wales Head of Drama and executive producer,&nbsp;Piers Wenger, immediately singled him out based on his performance.&nbsp;Smith additionally auditioned for the role of&nbsp;John Watson&nbsp;in the Moffat-created&nbsp;<em>Sherlock</em>, undergoing auditions at the same time; he was unsuccessful, as Moffat believed his eccentric acting style was closer to&nbsp;Holmes, whose role had already been given to Benedict Cumberbatch. At 26 years old, Smith was three years younger than&nbsp;Peter Davison&nbsp;was at the time of his casting as the Doctor in 1981, and younger than any other actor suggested for the role. After three weeks of auditions, Moffat and Wenger agreed that it had &quot;always been Matt&quot; and approached him to accept the role. The BBC were cautious about casting him because they felt that a 26-year-old could not play the Doctor adequately; Wenger shared the same sentiment but thought Smith had proven his acting quality in&nbsp;<em>Party Animals</em>, which Wenger thought highlighted Smith's &quot;mercurial&nbsp;qualities&quot;. Some fans of the show believed that Smith was inexperienced and too young for the role, while others supported him by citing his demonstrated acting ability.[23]&nbsp;For his performance in his first series he was nominated in the Outstanding Drama Performance Category of the&nbsp;National Television Awards. Smith is the first Doctor to be nominated for a&nbsp;BAFTA for Best Actor.</p>
      <p><br>
      Smith has said of his character: &quot;The Doctor is excited and fascinated by the tiniest of things. By everything. By every single thing. That's what's wonderful about him as a character. It's why children like him, I think. Because he doesn't dismiss anything. He's not cynical. He's open to every single facet of the universe.&quot; In June 2010, Smith appeared on stage with&nbsp;Orbital, and performed with them a version of the&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;theme, at the&nbsp;Glastonbury Festival.&nbsp;Smith hosted the&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;Promat the&nbsp;Royal Albert Hall&nbsp;on 24–25 July 2010. On the morning of 26 May 2012, Smith carried the&nbsp;Olympic torch&nbsp;in&nbsp;Cardiff, an activity which was noted by&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who </em>fans for its resemblance to a&nbsp;2006 episode&nbsp;of the show in which the Doctor carried the torch. On 1 June 2013, the BBC announced that Smith would be leaving <em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;at the end of the&nbsp;2013 Christmas special. </p>
      <p><br>
      Smith appeared in a&nbsp;deleted scene&nbsp;of the 2007 film&nbsp;<em>In Bruges</em>, playing a younger version of&nbsp;Ralph Fiennes' character. He starred in the 2009 short film&nbsp;<em>Together</em>&nbsp;and the 2010 film&nbsp;<em>Womb</em>. In February 2013, it was reported that Smith had signed up to appear in&nbsp;Ryan Gosling's directorial debut&nbsp;<em>How to Catch a Monster</em>, which has since been retitled&nbsp;<em>Lost River</em>. Smith's directorial debut, the short film&nbsp;<em>Cargese</em>, was aired on&nbsp;Sky Arts&nbsp;in May 2013.&nbsp;In May 2014, it was announced that he had been cast for a role in&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Genisys</em>,&nbsp;with the role set to expand in the second and third films in the&nbsp;series. </p>
      <p><br>
      During Smith's tenure in&nbsp;<em>On the Shore of the Wide World</em>, the play transferred to the&nbsp;Royal National Theatre&nbsp;in London. After finishing the play, he took on the role of Lockwood, a pupil in the&nbsp;Alan Bennett&nbsp;play&nbsp;<em>The History Boys</em>. After&nbsp;<em>The History Boys</em>, he would act in the teen play&nbsp;<em>Burn/Chatroom/Citizenship</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Swimming with Sharks</em>; the latter being his West End début, with Christian Slater.&nbsp;In 2007, Smith appeared as Henry in the critically acclaimed&nbsp;Polly Stenham&nbsp;play&nbsp;<em>That Face</em>&nbsp;at the&nbsp;Royal Court Theatre Upstairs&nbsp;in&nbsp;Chelsea. The play transferred to the&nbsp;Duke of York's Theatre&nbsp;in the&nbsp;West End&nbsp;in 2008 and became Smith's second role there.&nbsp;<em>That Face</em>&nbsp;focuses primarily upon alcohol and drug addiction in an upper-middle-class family after the paternal figure in the family leaves. As Henry, Smith portrayed an aspiring artist who left school to take care of his mother. </p>
      <p><br>
      The entire cast of the play was nominated for the 2008&nbsp;Laurence Olivier Award for Outstanding Achievement in an Affiliate Theatre,&nbsp;and Smith won the&nbsp;Evening Standard's award for &quot;best newcomer&quot; for his role.[ Upon its transfer to the West End, Smith's performance as Henry was highlighted as one of the positive aspects of the play by critics for the&nbsp;<em>Evening Standard</em>,&nbsp;<em>Daily Express</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Guardian</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Times</em>. </p>
      <p><br>
        On 7 October 2013, it was announced Smith would portray&nbsp;Patrick Bateman&nbsp;in the&nbsp;musical adaption of&nbsp;<em>American Psycho</em>&nbsp;at&nbsp;London's&nbsp;Almeida Theatre. The show began its run in December 2013. </p>
