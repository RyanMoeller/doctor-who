      <h1>Tom Baker</h1>
      <p>Tom Baker was born in Scotland Road, Liverpool, Lancashire. His parents were working class Liverpudlian; his mother, Mary Jane (née Fleming), a cleaner, was a devout Catholic and his father, John Stewart Baker, was a seaman. Baker attended Cheswardine Boarding School until he left school at 15 to become a Roman Catholic monk and remained in this lifestyle for six years, but left after losing his faith. He did his national service in the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving from 1955 until 1957. At the same time, he took up acting, first as a hobby but he turned professional towards the end of the 1960s.</p>
      <p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Baker was part of the National Theatre Company, then headed by Laurence Olivier, and had his first big film break with the role of Grigori Rasputin in the film <em>Nicholas and Alexandra</em> (1971) after Olivier had recommended him for the part.[1]He was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards for his performance, one for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and another for Best Newcomer. Baker appeared as Moore, an artist whose paintings are imbued with voodoo power, in <em>The Vault of Horror</em> (1973) and as Koura, the villainous sorcerer, in Ray Harryhausen's <em>The Golden Voyage of Sinbad</em> (1973).</p>
      <p>Baker also appeared in Pier Paolo Pasolini's 1972 version of Geoffrey Chaucer's <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> as the younger husband of the Wife of Bath.</p>
      <p>In 1974, Baker took over the role of the Doctor from Jon Pertwee to become the Fourth Doctor in the BBC TV series. He was recommended to producer Barry Letts by the BBC's Head of Serials, Bill Slater, who had directed Baker in a <em>Play of the Month</em> production of Shaw's play <em>The Millionairess</em>. Impressed by Baker upon meeting him, Letts was convinced he was right for the part after seeing his performance in <em>The Golden Voyage of Sinbad</em>. Baker was working on a construction site at the time, as acting jobs were scarce. Initially he was dubbed "Boiler Suit Tom" by the media because he had been supplied for a press conference with some old studio set clothes to replace his modest garments.</p>
      <p>Baker quickly made the part his own. As the Fourth Doctor, his eccentric style of dress and speech (particularly his trademark long scarf and fondness for jelly babies) made him an immediately recognisable figure, and he quickly caught the viewing public's imagination. Baker played the Doctor for seven consecutive seasons, making him the longest-serving actor in the part. Baker himself suggested many aspects of his Doctor's personality, but the distinctive scarf was created by accident. James Acheson, the costume designer assigned to his first story, had provided far more wool than was necessary to the knitter, Begonia Pope; Pope knitted all the wool she was given. It was Baker who suggested that he wear the ridiculously long scarf, which he did once it had been shortened a bit to make it more manageable. When John Nathan-Turner took over as producer of <em>Doctor Who</em> in 1980, Tom Baker was infuriated by the changes made to his wardrobe.</p>
      <p>The Doctor played by Tom Baker (1974–81) is often regarded as the most popular of the Doctors. In polls conducted by <em>Doctor Who Magazine</em>, Baker has lost the "Best Doctor" category only three times: once to Sylvester McCoy in 1990, and twice to David Tennant in 2006 and 2009. In a poll published by <em>BBC Homes and Antiques</em> magazine in January 2006, Baker was voted the fourth most eccentric star. He was beaten by Björk, Chris Eubank, and David Icke.</p>
      <p>Baker continues to be associated with the Doctor, appearing on documentaries such as <em>The Story of Doctor Who</em> and <em>Doctor Who Confidential</em> and giving interviews about his time on the programme. He reappeared as the Doctor for the 1993 charity special <em>Dimensions in Time</em> and audio for the PC game <em>Destiny of the Doctors</em>. In 1996 he appraised his time on the show as the highlight of his life. He is often interviewed as part of documentaries on the extras of <em>Doctor Who</em> DVD releases from his era as the Doctor and has recorded DVD commentaries for many of the stories. In a 2004 interview regarding the series' revival, Baker suggested that he be cast as the Master. In a 2006 interview with <em>The Sun</em> newspaper, he claims that he has not watched any episodes of the new series because he "just can't be bothered". In June 2006, Baker once again expressed interest in the role in a guest column for <em>Radio Times</em>, noting that he "did watch a little bit of the new <em>Doctor Who</em> and I think the new fella, Tennant, is excellent.<em>&quot;</em></p>
      <p>While Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, and Paul McGann have all reprised their roles for audio adventures produced since the 1990s by Big Finish (and sometimes the BBC), Baker had declined to voice the Doctor until 2009, claiming that he hadn't seen a script he liked. In July 2009, the BBC announced that Baker would return to the role for a series of five audio dramas, co-starring Richard Franklin as Captain Mike Yates, which would begin release in September. The five audios comprise a single linked story under the banner title <em>Hornets' Nest</em>, written by well-known author Paul Magrs. He returns with a sequel to <em>Hornets' Nest</em> called <em>Demon Quest</em>. Baker has also filmed inserts for a video release of the unfinished <em>Shada</em> in 1992, presented the video release <em>The Tom Baker Years</em> (a look back at his time on the series watching short clips from his episodes) and also provided narration for several BBC audio releases of old <em>Doctor Who</em> stories.</p>
      <p>In March 2011, it was announced that Baker would be returning as the Fourth Doctor initially for two series of plays for Big Finish Productions, starring alongside former companions Leela (Louise Jameson) and Romana I (Mary Tamm). The first series of six audios were released starting from January 2012.[14] Big Finish had also arranged for Baker to record a series of stories reuniting him with Elisabeth Sladen's character Sarah Jane Smith (for which special permission was obtained from the producers of <em>The Sarah Jane Adventures</em> TV series), but Sladen died in April 2011 before any stories could be recorded.</p>
      <p>Baker has been involved in the reading of old Target novelisations in the BBC Audio range of talking books, "Doctor Who (Classic Novels)". <em>Doctor Who and the Giant Robot</em> was the first release in the range read by Baker, released on 5 November 2007, followed by Baker reading <em>Doctor Who and the Brain of Morbius</em> (released 4 February 2008), <em>Doctor Who and the Creature from the Pit</em> (released on 7 April 2008) and <em>Doctor Who and the Pyramids of Mars</em> (released 14 August 2008). In October 2009, Baker was interviewed for BBC Radio 4's<em>Last Word</em> to pay tribute to the deceased former Doctor Who producer Barry Letts. He described Letts, who originally cast him in the role, as "the big link in changing my entire life".</p>
      <p>On 20 November 2013, Baker revealed that he would appear in <em>The Day of the Doctor</em>, the 50th anniversary special of <em>Doctor Who</em>, which aired on 23 November. He stated, "I am in the special. I'm not supposed to tell you that, but I tell you that very willingly and specifically; the BBC told me not to tell anybody but I'm telling you straightaway." The episode saw Baker in the role of a mysterious curator in the National Gallery.</p>
      <p>In 1982, Baker portrayed Sherlock Holmes in a four-part BBC1 miniseries version of <em>The Hound of the Baskervilles</em>; in the U.S., this production was telecast on A&amp;E. He also made an appearance in <em>Blackadder II</em>, in the episode "Potato", as the sea captain "Redbeard Rum". Much later, he played Puddleglum, a "marsh-wiggle", in the 1990 BBC adaptation of C.S. Lewis' <em>The Silver Chair</em>.</p>
      <p>For the third series of the British game show <em>Cluedo</em>, Baker was cast as Professor Plum, a "man with a degree in suspicion". He was also cast in the 2004 series <em>Strange</em>, as a blind priest who possessed knowledge of the Devil. Previously, he had appeared as a guest on the quiz show <em>Have I Got News For You</em> and was subsequently described by presenter Angus Deayton as the funniest guest in the series' history. A particular highlight was when Baker gave an anecdotal account of how, while entering a recording studio in Wales, he was accosted by a member of the public who told Baker: "I will never forgive you, nor will my wife, for what you did to our grammar schools." Baker responded with: "What are you talking about, you daft bugger?" to which the stranger replied: "I'm so sorry. For a moment I thought you were Shirley Williams."</p>
      <p>According to the <em>Daily Mirror</em>, Baker's appearance made him a cult figure once again, and helped revive his career. He later returned to <em>Have I Got News For You</em> as a guest host in 2008. Baker played the role of the Captain in theChallenge version of <em>Fort Boyard</em>, and has also hosted the children's literature series, <em>The Book Tower</em>. He has recorded a special called, <em>Tom Baker – In Confidence</em> that was shown in April 2010.</p>
      <p>In the late 1990s, it was reported that Baker was a candidate for the role of Gandalf in the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> films. Baker has since stated that he was only approached for "a role" in the film, and turned down the offer when told that it would mean spending months away in New Zealand. He appeared as Halvarth, the Elven healer, in <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> (2000).</p>
      <p>After his work on <em>Lionel Nimrod's Inexplicable World</em>, Baker was cast as a similar narrator of <em>Little Britain</em> on BBC Radio 4 and remained in the role when it transferred to television. Baker has suggested that he was chosen for the part in <em>Little Britain</em> due to his popularity with Lucas and Walliams, part of the generation to whom he is the favourite Doctor. "I am now being employed by the children who grew up watching me", he stated in a DVD commentary. Another trademark of Little Britain's narration is the deadpan quotation of old rap lyrics, usually in the opening credit sequence. On 17 November 2005, to mark the start of the third series of <em>Little Britain</em>, Baker read the continuity announcements on BBC One from 7  pm to 9:30  pm GMT. The scripts were written by Lucas and Walliams; Baker assumed his <em>Little Britain</em> persona. He used lines such as: "Hello, telly viewers. You're watching the BBC One! In half an hour, Jenny Dickens's classic serial <em>Bleak House</em>. But first let's see what the poor people are up to in the first of two visits this evening to the <em>EastEnders</em>."</p>
      <p>Baker's first marriage in 1961 was to Anna Wheatcroft (niece of the rose grower Harry Wheatcroft). They had two sons Daniel and Piers, but divorced in 1966 and Baker lost contact with his sons until a chance meeting with Piers in a pub in New Zealand allowed them to renew their relationship. In December 1980 he married Lalla Ward who had co-starred in <em>Doctor Who</em> (playing his companion Romana) with him for two years. However, the marriage lasted only 16 months.</p>
      <p>In 1986, Baker married for a third time, this time to Sue Jerrard, who had been an assistant editor on <em>Doctor Who</em>. They moved to the Bell House, a converted school in Boughton Malherbe near Maidstone, Kent where they kept several cats, before moving to France in January 2003. They sold the property to Jim Moir (Vic Reeves), shortly after Baker had worked with him on the BBC1 revival (2000–01) of <em>Randall &amp; Hopkirk (Deceased)</em>. In November 2006, Baker returned to live in the UK, initially buying a house in Tunbridge Wells, before later moving to the East Sussex countryside.</p>
      <p>Baker is sceptical of religion and describes himself as irreligious, or occasionally as Buddhist, but not anti-religious. "People are quite happy believing the wrong things. I wasn't unhappy believing all that shit. Now I'm not unhappy thinking about it because I can laugh at it." Politically, Baker has expressed disdain for both the Conservatives and the Labour Party saying, in 1998, "When the Conservatives were in I cannot tell you how much I hated them. But I realise how shallow I am because I now hate the Labour Party as much."</p>
