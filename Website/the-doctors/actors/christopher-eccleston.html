      <h1>Christopher Eccleston</h1>
      <p>Born into a&nbsp;working class&nbsp;family in&nbsp;Langworthy, Salford,&nbsp;Lancashire, Christopher Eccleston is the youngest of three sons of Elsie and Ronnie Eccleston.&nbsp;His brothers, Alan and Keith, are twins, eight years his senior. The family lived in a small&nbsp;terraced house&nbsp;in Blodwell Street until the late 1960s, when they moved to&nbsp;Little Hulton. Eccleston attended&nbsp;Joseph Eastham High School, where he became&nbsp;head boy.&nbsp;At the age of 19, he was inspired to enter the acting profession by such television dramas as&nbsp;<em>Boys from the Blackstuff</em>.</p>
      <p><br>
        Eccleston completed a two-year Performance Foundation Course at&nbsp;Salford Tech before going on to train at the&nbsp;Central School of Speech and Drama.&nbsp;As an actor, he was influenced in his early years by&nbsp;Ken Loach's&nbsp;<em>Kes</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Albert Finney's performance in&nbsp;<em>Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</em>; but he soon found himself performing the classics, including the works of&nbsp;Shakespeare,&nbsp;Chekhov&nbsp;and&nbsp;Molière. At the age of 25, Eccleston made his professional stage debut in the&nbsp;Bristol Old Vic's production of&nbsp;<em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em>. Underemployed as an actor for some years after graduating school, Eccleston took a variety of odd jobs at a supermarket, on building sites, and as an artist's model.</p>
<p>Eccleston first came to public attention as&nbsp;Derek Bentley&nbsp;in the film&nbsp;<em>Let Him Have It</em>&nbsp;(1991) and an episode of&nbsp;Inspector Morse, &quot;Second Time Around&quot; (1991). In 1992, he played the role of Sean Maddox in the&nbsp;BBC&nbsp;drama miniseries&nbsp;<em>Friday on my Mind</em>.&nbsp;A regular role in the television series&nbsp;<em>Cracker</em>&nbsp;(1993–94) brought him recognition in the UK; and, after he told TV bosses of his desire to leave the series, they killed off his character in October 1994, making him a victim of the serial killer Albie Kinsella (Robert Carlyle). At around the same time, Eccleston appeared in the episode &quot;One, Two, Buckle My Shoe&quot; of the&nbsp;<em>Poirot</em>&nbsp;series adapted from mysteries by Agatha Christie.</p>
<p><br>
  He appeared in the low-budget&nbsp;Danny Boyle&nbsp;film&nbsp;<em>Shallow Grave</em>&nbsp;(1994), in which he co-starred with actor&nbsp;Ewan McGregor. The same year, he won the part of Nicky Hutchinson in the epic&nbsp;BBC&nbsp;drama serial&nbsp;<em>Our Friends in the North</em>, whose broadcast on&nbsp;BBC Two&nbsp;in 1996 helped make him a household name in the UK. Eccleston starred in an ensemble cast that included actors&nbsp;Mark Strong&nbsp;and&nbsp;Gina McKee, as well as&nbsp;Daniel Craig. In 1996, he took the part of Trevor Hicks--a man who lost both of his daughters in the 1989&nbsp;Hillsborough disaster--in the television drama film&nbsp;<em>Hillsborough</em>, penned by&nbsp;Jimmy McGovern. In real life, he was the best man to Trevor Hicks at his marriage in March 2009. </p>
<p><br>
  His film career has since taken off with a variety of high-profile roles, including the title role in&nbsp;<em>Jude</em>&nbsp;(1996),&nbsp;<em>Elizabeth</em>&nbsp;(1998),&nbsp;<em>eXistenZ</em>&nbsp;(1999),&nbsp;<em>Gone in 60 Seconds</em>(2000),&nbsp;<em>The Others</em>&nbsp;(2001),&nbsp;<em>24 Hour Party People</em>&nbsp;(2002), and&nbsp;<em>28 Days Later</em>&nbsp;(2002). He played a major role as the protagonist of the 2002&nbsp;<em>Revengers Tragedy</em>, adapted from&nbsp;Thomas Middleton's&nbsp;play of the same name. He starred in the independent films&nbsp;<em>A Price Above Rubies</em>&nbsp;(1998) and&nbsp;<em>The Invisible Circus</em>&nbsp;(2001). He starred in the car-heist film&nbsp;<em>Gone in 60 Seconds</em>, but did not take his driving test until January 2004. He said on BBC's&nbsp;<em>Top Gear</em>&nbsp;that his licence restricts him to vehicles with automatic transmission.</p>
<p><br>
  He has appeared in a variety of television roles, especially in British dramas. These have included&nbsp;<em>Hearts and Minds</em>&nbsp;(1995) for Channel 4,&nbsp;<em>Clocking Off</em>&nbsp;(2000) and<em>Flesh and Blood</em>&nbsp;(2002) for the BBC and&nbsp;<em>Hillsborough</em>&nbsp;(1996), a modern version of&nbsp;<em>Othello</em>&nbsp;(2001), playing 'Ben Jago', (the&nbsp;Iago&nbsp;character); and the religious telefantasy epic&nbsp;<em>The Second Coming</em>&nbsp;(2003) for&nbsp;ITV, in which he played Steve Baxter, the son of God. He has made guest appearances in episodes of the comedy drama&nbsp;<em>Linda Green</em>&nbsp;(2001) and macabre sketch show&nbsp;<em>The League of Gentlemen</em>&nbsp;(2002). Eccleston appeared in a stage role in&nbsp;<em>Hamlet</em>&nbsp;in the 2002 production at&nbsp;Leeds's&nbsp;West Yorkshire Playhouse. March–April 2004 saw him return to the venue in a new play,&nbsp;<em>Electricity</em>.</p>
<p><br>
  Eccleston has been twice nominated in the Best Actor category at the&nbsp;British Academy Television Awards. His first nomination came in 1997 for&nbsp;<em>Our Friends in the North</em>, but he lost to&nbsp;Nigel Hawthorne&nbsp;(for&nbsp;<em>The Fragile Heart</em>). He was nominated in 2004 for&nbsp;<em>The Second Coming</em>;&nbsp;Bill Nighy&nbsp;won for&nbsp;<em>State of Play</em>. Eccleston won the Best Actor category at the 1997&nbsp;Broadcasting Press Guild&nbsp;Awards for&nbsp;<em>Our Friends in the North</em>. In 2003 he won the RTS Best Actor award for a second time, for his performance in&nbsp;<em>Flesh and Blood</em>. In July 2004, a poll of industry experts, conducted by&nbsp;<em>Radio Times</em>&nbsp;magazine, voted Eccleston the &quot;19th Most Powerful Person in Television Drama.&quot;</p>
<p><br>
  On 2 April 2004, it was announced that Eccleston was to play the ninth incarnation of&nbsp;the Doctor&nbsp;in the revival of the BBC&nbsp;science fiction television&nbsp;series&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>, which began transmission on 26 March 2005. Eccleston was the first actor to play the role who was born after the series began, albeit by less than three months. On 30 March 2005, the BBC released a statement, ostensibly from Eccleston, saying that he had decided to leave the role after just one series, because he feared becoming typecast. On 4 April 2005, the BBC revealed that Eccleston's &quot;statement&quot; was falsely attributed and released without his consent. The BBC admitted that they had broken an agreement made in January not to disclose publicly that he only intended to do one series. The statement had been made after journalists made queries to the press office. </p>
<p><br>
  On 11 June 2005, during a&nbsp;BBC radio&nbsp;interview, when asked if he had enjoyed working on&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>, Eccleston responded by saying, &quot;Mixed, but that's a long story.&quot; Eccleston's reasons for leaving the role continue to be debated in Britain's newspapers: on 4 October 2005&nbsp;Alan Davies&nbsp;told&nbsp;<em>The Daily Telegraph</em>&nbsp;that Eccleston had been &quot;overworked&quot; by the BBC, and had left the role because he was &quot;exhausted&quot;.Ten days later, Eccleston told the&nbsp;<em>Daily Mirror</em>&nbsp;this was not true, and expressed some irritation at Davies for his comments. In a 2010 interview, Eccleston revealed that he left the show because he &quot;didn't enjoy the environment and the culture that the cast and crew had to work in&quot;, but that he was proud of having played the role. </p>
<p><br>
  On 7 November 2008, at the&nbsp;National Theatre&nbsp;to promote his book&nbsp;<em>The Writer's Tale</em>,&nbsp;Russell T. Davies&nbsp;said that Eccleston's contract was for a single year because it was uncertain whether the show would continue beyond a single revival series. In retrospect, he says, it has been an enormous success, but at the time there were doubts within the BBC. Eccleston was voted &quot;Most Popular Actor&quot; at the 2005&nbsp;National Television Awards&nbsp;for his portrayal of the Doctor.</p>
<p><br>
  In July 2012, Eccleston spoke positively of his time on&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;during a talk at the&nbsp;National Theatre. This led to speculation he was considering making a return appearance as the&nbsp;Ninth Doctor&nbsp;for the show's 50th anniversary special, &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, in 2013. The 11th Doctor,&nbsp;Matt Smith, stated that he would love Eccleston to return. However, after discussing with executive producer&nbsp;Steven Moffat, Eccleston declined his role. </p>
<p><br>
  On 30 October 2005, Eccleston appeared on stage at the&nbsp;Old Vic&nbsp;theatre in London in the one-night play&nbsp;<em>Night Sky</em>&nbsp;alongside Navin Chowdhry,&nbsp;Bruno Langley,&nbsp;David Warner,&nbsp;Saffron Burrows&nbsp;and&nbsp;David Baddiel. Eccleston sat on the 2nd Amazonas International Film Festival Film Jury in November 2005. The director&nbsp;Norman Jewison&nbsp;was chairman of the Jury. In December 2005, Eccleston travelled to&nbsp;Indonesia's&nbsp;Aceh&nbsp;province for the&nbsp;<em>BBC Breakfast</em>&nbsp;news programme, examining how survivors of the&nbsp;2004 Boxing Day tsunami&nbsp;were rebuilding their lives. <br>
  In March 2006, Eccleston appeared in the&nbsp;ITV&nbsp;documentary special&nbsp;<em>Best Ever Muppet Moments</em>&nbsp;as a commentator. In May 2006, he appeared as the narrator in a production of&nbsp;<em>Romeo and Juliet</em>&nbsp;at&nbsp;the Lowry&nbsp;theatre in his home city of Salford. The theatre company with which he performed, Celebrity Pig (of which he is patron), is made up of&nbsp;learning disabled&nbsp;actors. In August 2006, Eccleston filmed&nbsp;<em>New Orleans, Mon Amour</em>&nbsp;with&nbsp;Elisabeth Moss. The film was directed by&nbsp;Michael Almereyda&nbsp;and shot in post-Hurricane Katrina&nbsp;New Orleans. It was released in 2008 to film festivals in America and Italy.</p>
<p><br>
  Late in 2006 he starred in&nbsp;<em>Perfect Parents</em>, an&nbsp;ITV&nbsp;drama written and directed by&nbsp;Joe Ahearne, who had directed him in&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>. Eccleston joined the cast of the NBC&nbsp;TV series&nbsp;<em>Heroes</em>&nbsp;in the episode &quot;Godsend&quot;, which was broadcast on 22 January 2007. Eccleston played a character named&nbsp;Claude&nbsp;who has the power of invisibility, and helps&nbsp;Peter Petrelli&nbsp;with his powers.&nbsp;Eccleston appeared as&nbsp;the Rider&nbsp;in a&nbsp;film adaptation&nbsp;of&nbsp;Susan Cooper's novel&nbsp;<em>The Dark Is Rising</em>, which opened in the USA on 5 October 2007.</p>
<p><br>
  Eccleston appeared on the BBC Four World Cinema Award show in February 2008, arguing the merits of five international hits such as&nbsp;<em>The Lives of Others</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Pan's Labyrinth</em>&nbsp;with&nbsp;Jonathan Ross&nbsp;and&nbsp;Archie Panjabi. In 2009, Eccleston starred opposite Archie Panjabi in a short film called&nbsp;<em>The Happiness Salesman</em>. Eccleston agreed to do the film because of Panjabi and the fact that it was a winner of the British Short Screenplay Competition. He also appeared as the villainous&nbsp;Destro&nbsp;in the&nbsp;G.I. Joe film,&nbsp;<em>G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra</em>. Eccleston also appeared in an episode of&nbsp;<em>The Sarah Silverman Program</em>&nbsp;as the titular cult favourite science fiction hero in a show-within-the-show called &quot;Dr. Laser Rage&quot;, possibly in reference to his stint in&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>.</p>
<p><br>
  Eccleston was cast as&nbsp;John Lennon&nbsp;in a&nbsp;BBC&nbsp;production called&nbsp;<em>Lennon Naked</em>&nbsp;which aired in the UK on 23 June 2010,&nbsp;with Eccleston playing the title role, and Naoko Mori, who had previously appeared with him in&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>, as&nbsp;Yoko Ono. In November 2010, Eccleston starred in the first episode of&nbsp;BBC One&nbsp;anthology drama&nbsp;<em>Accused</em>. He won an International Emmy Award for his role. In May 2011, he starred as Joseph Bede in&nbsp;<em>The Shadow Line</em>, a seven-part television drama serial for&nbsp;BBC Two.</p>
<p><br>
  On 31 December 2011, Eccleston played the role of Pod Clock in an adaptation of&nbsp;Mary Norton's children's novel&nbsp;<em>The Borrowers</em>&nbsp;on BBC One. In July 2012, he starred in the political thriller&nbsp;<em>Blackout</em>&nbsp;on BBC One. In the same month, he starred as&nbsp;Creon&nbsp;in an adaptation of&nbsp;<em>Antigone</em>&nbsp;at the&nbsp;Royal National Theatre; his performance in the play was called &quot;charismatic&quot; and &quot;intense&quot;.</p>
 In 2013, Eccleston portrayed the villainous&nbsp;Malekith&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>Thor: The Dark World</em>, the sequel to&nbsp;<em>Thor</em>&nbsp;and the eighth installment in the&nbsp;Marvel Cinematic Universe. In 2014, he portrayed Reverend Matt Jamison on the&nbsp;HBO&nbsp;drama series&nbsp;<em>The Leftovers</em>.    <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></td>
