      <h1>2005 Revival</h1>
      <p>Following the 1996 television movie, Universal retained some rights to produce new&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;stories, but without a broadcaster attached, they allowed those rights to expire. Full production rights therefore reverted to the BBC in 1997.<br>
Little happened at the BBC regarding new&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;production until the following year, when producer&nbsp;Mal Young&nbsp;arrived at the Corporation's in-house production arm as Head of Continuing Drama Series. Young was keen on reviving the programme, and this interest was shared by the then-current Controller of BBC One,&nbsp;Peter Salmon. Tony Wood, a producer in Young's department, who previously worked at&nbsp;Granada Television, recalled his former colleague&nbsp;Russell T Davies' enthusiasm for the programme and recommended him to Young as someone who might make a good writer of a new version. Davies had recently written for the popular Granada dramas&nbsp;<em>The Grand</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Touching Evil</em>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;ITV&nbsp;network, and earlier in the decade had worked for the BBC, writing the well-received children's science-fiction serials <em>Century Falls</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Dark Season</em>, which itself contained many&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>-influenced themes.</p>
      <p><br>
        A meeting was arranged between Davies and Mal Young's development producer, Patrick Spence. In 1999 the media took hold of the story following the success and critical acclaim surrounding Davies'&nbsp;Channel 4&nbsp;drama,&nbsp;<em>Queer as Folk</em>. Although various sources claimed that a provisional title of&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who 2000</em>&nbsp;had been given to the proposed new series, in reality very little work had been done, as Peter Salmon had been informed by&nbsp;BBC Worldwide&nbsp;that a new series would upset the tentative plans they were making for a new film version of the series. Thus, plans for the television revival were shelved for the time, and seemed to become even less likely in 2000 when Salmon was replaced as Controller of BBC One.</p>
      <p><br>
        However, Salmon's successor,&nbsp;Lorraine Heggessey, proved to be equally enthusiastic about the idea of new&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>, often commenting to the press that she would like to pursue the idea but that &quot;rights difficulties&quot; – presumably BBC Worldwide's film negotiations – prevented it. Equally positive comments were made by the Corporation's overall Head of Drama,&nbsp;Jane Tranter. Heggessey had received several new series proposals since she had taken over control of BBC One, the highest-profile being from producer&nbsp;Dan Freedman&nbsp;– who had produced a full-cast, official, audio&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;story, entitled&nbsp;<em>Death Comes to Time</em>, for the&nbsp;BBCi&nbsp;website in 2001. Another came from actor/writer&nbsp;Mark Gatiss, who in 2002 drew up and submitted a proposal in collaboration with writer&nbsp;Gareth Roberts&nbsp;and then&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who Magazine</em>&nbsp;editor&nbsp;Clayton Hickman.</p>
      <p><br>
        In the meantime,&nbsp;BBCi, the interactive media arm of the corporation, who had scored successes with their&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;webcasts (beginning with the aforementioned <em>Death Comes to Time</em>, which was followed by&nbsp;<em>Real Time</em>&nbsp;in 2002 and a re-make of the uncompleted&nbsp;<em>Shada</em>&nbsp;in 2003), decided on a more ambitious project to celebrate the programme's upcoming 40th anniversary. In July 2003, BBCi announced the production of&nbsp;<em>Scream of the Shalka</em>, a fully animated adventure adapted for webcasting with&nbsp;Richard E. Grant&nbsp;as&nbsp;the Doctor&nbsp;and Sir&nbsp;Derek Jacobi&nbsp;as&nbsp;the Master. As there were no concrete plans for producing a new series, BBCi announced&nbsp;<em>Shalka</em>&nbsp;as the &quot;official&quot; continuation of the programme, and that Grant was the &quot;official&quot; Ninth Doctor. However, events were soon to overtake that.<br>
        In September 2003, Heggessey managed to persuade Worldwide that as several years had now passed and they were no nearer to producing a film, BBC television should be allowed to make a new series. The other proposals notwithstanding, Tranter and Heggessey elected to approach Davies once again, who had often told the BBC when approached for other projects that he would only return to them to take charge of a new series of&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>. He quickly accepted, and on 26 September 2003 it was officially announced that&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;would be returning to&nbsp;BBC One, produced in-house at&nbsp;BBC Wales&nbsp;in 2004 for transmission in 2005.<br>
        Davies was made the chief writer and Executive Producer of the new series (called Series One instead of continuing the numbering with Season 27, although the narrative thread continued from the old series rather than starting afresh), and other writers included&nbsp;Mark Gatiss,&nbsp;Steven Moffat,&nbsp;Paul Cornell&nbsp;and&nbsp;Rob Shearman. The Producer was&nbsp;Phil Collinson&nbsp;and the other Executive Producers were&nbsp;Mal Young&nbsp;(although he subsequently left the BBC midway through production at the end of 2004), and BBC Wales Head of Drama,&nbsp;Julie Gardner. A new arrangement of the theme tune was composed by&nbsp;Murray Gold. Gardner later commented that the choice of&nbsp;Cardiff&nbsp;as the base for filming the series was the result of a combination of factors. She and Davies, who had worked together on the BBC drama series&nbsp;<em>Casanova</em>starring David Tennant, were both from Wales; the BBC was looking to move more of its productions away from London; and there was a good variety of filming locations in the area. </p>
      <p><br>
        The new series would comprise thirteen 45-minute long episodes, with the first story titled &quot;Rose&quot; after the Doctor's new companion&nbsp;Rose Tyler. Unlike past seasons which used serial-style storytelling, the new series would have mainly standalone or two-part episodes. Filming of the first season began in Cardiff on 18 July 2004. With the new series confirmed, when&nbsp;<em>Shalka</em>&nbsp;was webcast in November 2003, the further adventures of Grant's Ninth Doctor were in doubt. In February 2004, plans for sequels to&nbsp;<em>Shalka</em>&nbsp;were indefinitely shelved, although Grant's version of the character, now dubbed the &quot;Shalka Doctor&quot;, would return in a short story entitled &quot;The Feast of the Stone&quot; published on the BBC website. <br>
        After much speculation in the press about possible candidates, BBC announced that&nbsp;Christopher Eccleston&nbsp;would be the&nbsp;Ninth Doctor, accompanied by former pop singer&nbsp;Billie Piper&nbsp;as Rose. In the April 2004 issue of&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who Magazine</em>, Davies announced that Eccleston's Doctor would indeed be the Ninth Doctor, relegating Grant's Ninth Doctor to non-official status.<br>
        In April 2004, Michael Grade returned to the BBC, this time as the Chairman of the&nbsp;Board of Governors, although this position does not involve any commissioning or editorial responsibilities. Although he was quoted as being generally indifferent to the new series, he eventually wrote an e-mail to&nbsp;BBC Director-General&nbsp;Mark Thompson&nbsp;in June 2005, after the successful new first series, voicing approval for its popularity. He also declared, &quot;I never dreamed I would ever write this. I must be going soft!&rdquo; </p>
      <p><br>
        However, not everyone was pleased with the new production. Some fans criticised the new logo and perceived changes to the TARDIS model. According to various news sources, members of the production team even received hate mail and death threats.&nbsp;The new logo and trailers were posted on the BBC website and were followed up by television spots in March 2005 with a media blitz in the run up to the transmission of &quot;Rose&quot; on 26 March. An employee of a third party company associated with the&nbsp;Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&nbsp;leaked a rough cut of the premiere on the internet; the leak attracted much media attention and discussion amongst fans. Advance reviews in the British media were generally positive. <br>
  &quot;Rose&quot; finally saw transmission on on 26 March at 7&nbsp;pm on BBC One, the first regular episode of&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;for over 15&nbsp;years. To complement the series, BBC Wales also produced&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who Confidential</em>, a 13-part documentary series with each episode broadcast on&nbsp;BBC Three&nbsp;immediately after the end of the weekly instalment on BBC One. &quot;Rose&quot; received average overnight ratings of 9.9&nbsp;million viewers, peaking at 10.5&nbsp;million.&nbsp;The final figure for the episode, including video recordings watched within a week of transmission, was 10.81&nbsp;million, No. 3 for BBC One that week and No. 7 across all channels. The success of the launch saw the BBC's Head of Drama&nbsp;Jane Tranter&nbsp;confirming on 30 March that the series would return both for a Christmas Special in December 2005 and a full second series in 2006.</p>
      <p><br>
        The series was well received by both critics and the public. The 2005 TV Choice/TV Quick Award went to Eccleston for Best Actor, and&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;was nominated for Best Series. Eccleston, Piper, and&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;were all winners in their categories at the UK's&nbsp;National Television Awards, announced on 25 October 2005. Although not as prestigious as the&nbsp;British Academy Television Awards&nbsp;(BAFTAs), they are the highest-profile UK television awards voted on by members of the public. The series did go on to win two BAFTA awards in May, including the Best Drama Series category.<br>
        Due to an initial lack of interest by networks in the United States,&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;debuted on the&nbsp;Sci Fi Channel&nbsp;on 17 March 2006, one year after the Canadian and UK showings.</p>
    Although the new series clearly continues the storyline of the original – with Eccleston identified in publicity materials as the Ninth Doctor, and the appearance of original series elements such as UNIT and&nbsp;Sarah-Jane Smith—the BBC is officially treating the series as a new programme, calling the 2005 season &quot;Series 1&quot;. This has led to controversy between fans who wish to follow the BBC's numbering and those who consider the 2005 series to be Season 27 (and so on).    <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></td>
