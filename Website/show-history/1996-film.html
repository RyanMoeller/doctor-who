      <h1>1996 Film</h1>
      <p><img src="../images/show history/1996-film.jpg" width="250" height="250" class="image-rap">Although in-house production had ceased, the BBC were hopeful of finding an independent production company to re-launch the show and had been approached for such a venture as early as July 1989 (while the 26th series was still in production)[18]&nbsp;by&nbsp;Philip Segal, a British expatriate who worked for&nbsp;Columbia Pictures' television arm in the United States.[18]&nbsp;Segal's negotiations dragged on for several years, and followed him from Columbia to&nbsp;Steven Spielberg's&nbsp;Amblin Entertainment&nbsp;company and finally to&nbsp;Universal Studios' television arm. At Amblin, Segal had come close to interesting the&nbsp;CBS&nbsp;network in commissioning the series as a mid-season replacement show in 1994, but this eventually came to nothing.</p>
      <p><br>
        Finally, at Universal, Segal managed to interest the&nbsp;Fox Network&nbsp;in the programme, in the form of their Vice-President in charge of Television Movie production,&nbsp;Trevor Walton, an Englishman who was already familiar with the series. Although Walton had no power to commission a series, he was able to commission a one-time television movie that served as a&nbsp;backdoor pilot&nbsp;for a possible series revival. The movie that was eventually made was simply titled&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>. To distinguish it from the television series, Segal later suggested the alternate title&nbsp;<em>Enemy Within</em>. Opinions on how to refer to the television movie differ among fans, but the most common usage is to just call it the &quot;television movie&quot; or abbreviate it as &quot;the TVM&quot;.</p>
      <p><br>
        The original plan was for a completely new American version of&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>, in the same way that&nbsp;<em>Sanford and Son</em>&nbsp;was an unrelated re-make of&nbsp;<em>Steptoe and Son</em>&nbsp;and<em>All in the Family</em>&nbsp;had re-made&nbsp;<em>Till Death Us Do Part</em>. However, when new scriptwriter&nbsp;Matthew Jacobs&nbsp;came on board in 1995 – at Walton's persuasion, feeling that a simpler story was needed than the intricate back-stories Segal had created with writer&nbsp;John Leekley&nbsp;– he persuaded Segal that the movie should instead be a direct continuation of the BBC series, something no American production had ever attempted before when buying the rights to a British programme.<br>
        Segal agreed, and Sylvester McCoy appeared briefly at the beginning of the film, before &quot;regenerating&quot; into the&nbsp;Eighth Doctor&nbsp;as played by&nbsp;Paul McGann. McGann had been Segal's first choice for the part, although both the actor himself and the Fox Network had not initially been keen. Segal later claimed that the BBC's Executive Producer on the project, Jo Wright, had wanted the role of the &quot;previous Doctor&quot; to be played by Tom Baker, as it was felt he was regarded as the definitive Doctor by the British public and McCoy's tenure had not been as popular, but she backed down when Segal explained how this went against the continuity of the programme. Segal also had to fight to retain the familiar&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;theme: composer&nbsp;John Debney&nbsp;wanted to write a new piece, but was convinced to create a rearrangement ofRon Grainer's composition, although Grainer did not receive screen credit for his work. A further tie to the BBC series was the use of the logo used from 1970 to 1973 during the Jon Pertwee era. This logo subsequently became the official franchise logo until it was replaced in 2004, although it still appears on all merchandise featuring any of the original series Doctors.</p>
      <p><br>
        Transmitted on the&nbsp;Fox Network&nbsp;on 14 May 1996 and on&nbsp;BBC One&nbsp;thirteen days later – although actually having debuted on&nbsp;CityTV&nbsp;in Toronto, Canada, the film having been shot in Vancouver, on 12 May – the production drew only 5.5&nbsp;million viewers in the United States, although it was far more successful in the UK with 9&nbsp;million viewers, one of the top-ten programmes of the week.</p>
      <p>McGann's Doctor was a combination of boyish glee and wonder at the universe with occasional flashes of an old soul in a young body, and was well received by fans, even if the reactions to the television movie were mixed. However, in spite of the success and popularity of the film in the UK, the disappointing US viewing figures led Fox to decline to commission a series. With no broadcast network attached in the United States, Universal could not produce a series for the BBC alone. Indeed, it would have been cheaper for the BBC to make a new series themselves rather than pay for a series with no production partner. Thus plans for a new series were scrapped, with no new production looking likely as the decade came to an end. </p>
